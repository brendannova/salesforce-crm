Hi {CLIENT 1 NAME} &amp; {CLIENT 2 NAME},

Your documents are now in the portal!

One of the most requested features from customers is the ability to access advice and tax documents directly through our portal instead of Dropbox. We are pleased to announce that we have developed a secure document section within the portal where you can now access all your documents. This enhancement will improve the security of your documents and streamline your experience by consolidating everything in one place, where you already view your investment performance and update your profile.

How can I access documents in the portal?

Simply log in as usual and access documents from the menu, or use this link to go directly there &lt; https://portal.novawm.com/documents &gt; . In this new section, you can view PDFs and stream your meeting recordings.

What documents can be accessed in the portal?

All the documents previously available in Dropbox, such as advice meeting recordings, presentations, or any historic tax documents are now accessible in the portal.

As before, we will notify you whenever important documents are shared with you.

Can I still access my documents via Dropbox?

No, we&#39;ve removed your access to Dropbox since all of your documents are now in the portal.

Kind regards

Amy Farringdon
