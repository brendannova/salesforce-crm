    <description>Use this to outline the LLs that will be provided (i.e. base vs advice) plus any client specific assumptions/deviations to the normal default assumptions. Onboarding cases should only have a base &amp; advice line as default. Additional modelling to be avoided where possible (can be covered in follow on advice/annual reviews as appropriate). This field must clearly set the partner&apos;s expectations for the modelling. Anything not outlined/agreed within this section cannot be changed once the deck is complete.</description>
