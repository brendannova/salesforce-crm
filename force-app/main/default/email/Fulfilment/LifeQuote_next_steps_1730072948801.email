This is to complete a questionnaire in relation to your medical history, the medical history of your immediate family and some additional lifestyle questions.&nbsp;<br />
​<br />
The call should take no more than 20 minutes <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>per person</em></span>. Please ensure you have any medical history to hand for yourself and your immediate family, including any details regarding GP and hospital appointments and any diagnoses you may have received.&nbsp;<br />
​<br />
Once the policies are in force, LifeQuote will issue you paper forms to arrange for the policies to be placed in trust.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;">​For your reference, your Assurance Trust applications will be placed on hold until we have completed your protection applications and your new policies are in force.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
