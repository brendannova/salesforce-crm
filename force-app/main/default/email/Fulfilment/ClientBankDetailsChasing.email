<br />
Just a friendly reminder to please provide us with your bank details, so that we can start putting our recommendations in place.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As a reminder, you can share your bank account details with us using a secure form (link below).<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[My/CLIENT 1’s bank account details] [INSERT LINK]</em></span><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color:#e74c3c;">[CLIENT 2’s bank account details] [INSERT LINK]</span></em><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[A joint account will suffice, if you have one. In this case only one secure form needs to be completed.]<br />
<br />
You will need to enter the password that you set up previously for our questionnaire. Please let me know if you have any issues accessing the form or need me to reset your password.</em></span><br />
<br />
We will never ask you to share your bank details with us via email. Instead, we will only ever ask you to share your bank details with us via a secure, password protected form. If you are ever unsure of a request, please give us a call to confirm.<br />
<br />
I hope this is clear. However, please do get in touch if you have any questions.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
