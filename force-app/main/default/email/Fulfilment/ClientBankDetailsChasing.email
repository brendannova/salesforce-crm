<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Just a friendly reminder to please provide us with your bank details, so that we can start putting our recommendations in place.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As a reminder, you can share your bank account details with us <a href="https://portal.novawm.com/payment-details/">via the portal.</a></span></p>

<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">For security reasons, we will never ask you to share your bank details with us via email, we will only ask for these using the secure portal. If you are ever unsure of a request, please give us a call to confirm.<br />
<br />
I hope this is clear. However, please do get in touch if you have any questions.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
