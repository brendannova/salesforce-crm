<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Thank you for letting me know that you would like to cancel your regular payment into your NOVA <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[DELETE AS REQUIRED] </em></span>GIA/ISA/SIPP. I will ask the team to process this now.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[If within 10wd of next regular date]</em></span><br />
It can take a short while for our custodian to make the changes to your account. Since your next payment date is on the 1st<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[SIPPs]</em></span>/18th<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[GIA/ISA]</em></span>, we recommend canceling the Direct Debit through your bank as well. This ensures that no payment is taken while the changes are being processed.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[If within 3wd of next regular date]</em></span><br />
As the next payment date is on the 1st<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[SIPPs]</em></span>/18th<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[GIA/ISA]</em></span> of <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Month]</em></span>, we will be unable to cancel your payment in time as your bank will already have started processing your payment. However, we will ensure that it is cancelled going forward.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you require any further assistance.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
