<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT 1 FIRST NAME] &amp; [CLIENT 2 FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Further to my previous email, it appears that we do not hold a record of the bank details that you used to transfer into your NOVA <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>SIPP/ISA/JISA/GIA.</em></span><br />
<br />
<strong>So that we can verify the source of payment, please can you provide us with a bank statement dated within the last three months that clearly states your name, sort code and account number used to make this payment?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either attach a copy of your statement to this email or if youâ€™d prefer, you can upload a copy to your secure questionnaire by clicking here <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[INSERT LINK TO MOST RECENT FULL FACT FIND VIA PRECISEFP}</em></span>. If you choose to upload the statement to your questionnaire, please click where indicated within Section 7 - Cash.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The account details we currently hold relate to your joint <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[BANK NAME]</em></span> account ending<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em> ****1234</em></span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please could you also confirm whether we should update our systems so that this is your nominated bank account going forward?<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any questions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
