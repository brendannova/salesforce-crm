<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT 1 PREFERRED NAME] &amp; [CLIENT 2 PREFERRED NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Initial payment email]</em></span><br />
Following on from our advice, we're now ready to start making investments on your behalf. <strong>Please look to make these payments as soon as possible upon receipt of this email. Any delay may result in you missing the deadline and your tax allowances for this year being lost.</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Chaser only]</em></span><br />
Given that the tax year-end deadline is approaching, I am getting in touch with a friendly reminder regarding which payments we are waiting for. <strong>Please look to make these payments as soon as possible upon receipt of this email. &nbsp;Any delay may result in you missing the deadline and your tax allowances for this year being lost.</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[DO NOT USE FOR FIRST PAYMENT DETAILS EMAIL - ONLY CHASERS]<br />
It can take a day or so (particularly during this busy time) for payments to be visible in our system, so if you have already made a payment, please just reply to this email confirming this and we will be in touch to acknowledge receipt.&nbsp;</em></span><br />
<br />
Please transfer payments using the following information: <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[COMPLETE DETAILS/DELETE OPTIONS N/A]</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>NOVA SIPP/ISA/GIA/Offshore Bond /&nbsp;Apollo VCT / Titan VCT /&nbsp;AIM VCT /&nbsp;OITS/AIMITS/AIMISA<br />
Amount: [£]<br />
Reference: [HUBWISE POLICY NUMBER]</em></span><br />
<br />
Please make sure all payments are sent from your nominated bank account. As a reminder, your nominated account is your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[BANK NAME]</em></span> account ending <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>****1234</em></span>.<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>(NOTE - YOU SHOULD REFERENCE THE BANK ACCOUNT SHOWN WITHIN HUBWISE, NOT SALESFORCE)</em></span><br />
<br />
For your security, the required bank details are shown on your portal, you just need to navigate to the client payment details on the right-hand side. Alternatively, use the direct link below. You will have been sent an email to activate your portal previously.<br />
<br />
To access the payment details in your portal please click&nbsp;<a href="https://">here</a>.<br />
<br />
We will never share complete bank details with you via email. If you are ever unsure of a transfer request, please give us a call to confirm.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>Your bank may limit how much can be transferred in a single payment (often to £20,000). Please contact your bank to request a higher limit as investment will only begin once we have received the full amount.</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#c0392b;"><strong>Please ensure payment is made by the 4th of April to ensure the tax year-end deadline is met.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
<br />
Please let me know when you have made the payment(s) so that I can confirm safe receipt.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please do get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
