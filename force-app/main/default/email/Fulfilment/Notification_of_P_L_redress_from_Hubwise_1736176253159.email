<br />
I hope you’re well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I’m just getting in touch to let you know that you will shortly receive a redress payment of £<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>X</em></span> into your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Nova product/nominated bank account]</em></span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is the compensation owed to you due to a delay in investment into your ISA/GIA/SIPP. <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>&lt;--[DELETE AS REQUIRED]</em></span><br />
<br />
We have been working with Hubwise to ensure that appropriate compensation is provided and additional controls are implemented to prevent future delays in investment.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
