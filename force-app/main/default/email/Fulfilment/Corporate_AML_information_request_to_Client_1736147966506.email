Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Client]</em></span><br />
<br />
I hope you're well.<br />
<br />
We are in the process of setting up your pension contribution from <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[COMPANY NAME]</em></span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[SHAREHOLDER NAME]</em></span> is listed as a person with significant control, we are required to run additional checks on them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In order for us to contact them and request their permission for these checks, please provide us with their email address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please do let me know. I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
