<br />
We have now submitted the transfer of your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVIDER] [PRODUCT TYPE]</em></span>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Therefore, please can I ask that you cancel your monthly direct debit with immediate effect, so that no further payments are made.<br />
<br />
I'd be grateful if you could confirm once the direct debit has been cancelled so that we can update our records.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Amy</span></p>
