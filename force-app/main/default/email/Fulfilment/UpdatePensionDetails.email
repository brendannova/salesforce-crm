<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Hope you are well.<br />
<br />
I am just getting in touch with regards to your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVIDER/PRODUCT]</em></span> transfer and they confirmed that they hold an old address for you which is holding up the transfer. Unfortunately, they won't allow us to update this for you on your behalf.<br />
<br />
Therefore, please could you contact [PROVIDER] to update your address. They confirmed you can do this <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[RELAY PROVIDER INSTRUCTIONS]</em></span>. If you could please let us know once you've contacted them, we will also contact to ensure the transfer proceeds.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help in this matter.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
