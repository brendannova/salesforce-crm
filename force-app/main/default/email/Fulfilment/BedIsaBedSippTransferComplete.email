<p style="line-height:1.38">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
I hope you're well.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>For ISA:</em></span><br />
<br />
As previously agreed, I’m pleased to confirm that we’ve now transferred <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>£20,000</em></span> from your NOVA GIA to your NOVA ISA. This means that we have now used <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>your 2024/25 ISA allowances/ used X amount of your 2024/25 ISA allowance. Please do not add funds to any other ISA during the tax year.</em></span><br />
<br />
As per our advice, we have invested the funds within Passive Plus<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em> XX</em></span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>For SIPP</em></span><br />
<br />
As previously agreed, I can confirm that we have now transferred <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>£2,880 </em></span>from your NOVA GIA to your NOVA SIPP.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should bear this in mind when contributing to any other pensions so that your total contributions do not exceed your annual allowance.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As per our advice, we have invested the funds within Passive Plus <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>XX</em></span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can monitor the ongoing value of your assets through our portal and this will be updated in the&nbsp;coming days.<br />
