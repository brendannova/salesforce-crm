Good news. Weâ€™ve completed the transfer of your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[POLICY NAME]</em></span> to your NOVA <em><span style="color:#e74c3c;">[[</span></em> GIA / ISA <em><span style="color:#e74c3c;">]]</span></em>.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[REMOVE IF NOT REQUIRED]</em></span> There is residual cash remaining with the ceding provider, which we expect will transfer in the future. We will update your portal once this is received.<br />
