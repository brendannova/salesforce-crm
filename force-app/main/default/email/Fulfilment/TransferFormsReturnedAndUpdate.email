<br />
Many thanks for sending your transfer forms back to us. Everything has been safely received.<br />
<br />
Because we can’t control how quickly third-party providers work it may take anything up to a few weeks for all the <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[accounts to be opened] / [transfers to be completed]</em></span>.<br />
<br />
We’ll keep you updated about how we’re getting on but if you have any questions, please do get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
