<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT 1 FIRST NAME]</em></span> &amp; <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT 2 FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
I hope you’re well.<br />
<br />
I am pleased to confirm that we have set up your direct debit starting <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>{enter date}</em></span>. Unfortunately, the setup has been delayed and, as per our advice, should have begun on <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>DAY MONTH</em></span>. To ensure you still utilise your allowances for the year, we have two options available to cover the missed payments:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We can increase your next direct debit payment to cover the missed payments. This would mean that your payment on <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>DAY MONTH</em></span> will be £<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>XXXX</em></span>. Payments from <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>DAY MONTH</em></span> will revert back to the original amount of £<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>XXX</em></span>.<br />
Alternatively, you can make a one-off payment into your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[account]</em></span> of £<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>XXX</em></span>. In this instance, please provide us with an update on your current cash position so that we can update our advice.<br />
<br />
I hope this is clear but if you have any questions please do not hesitate to get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
