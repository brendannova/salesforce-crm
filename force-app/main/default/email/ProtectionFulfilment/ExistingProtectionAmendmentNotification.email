Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Hope you're well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm just getting in touch regarding your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[provider &amp; protection type policy e.g. LV income protection] </em></span>policy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You should have received a letter from <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Provider] </em></span>outlining the details from their latest annual review.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They have let us know that your monthly premium has increased by <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>Â£X</em></span>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Your policy is inflation linked so this is an expected change. There is no action needed unless you do not wish to accept the increase.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any questions.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
