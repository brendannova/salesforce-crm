<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
As you know, we’re currently contacting your providers to gather the information needed to build your personalised financial plan.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I wanted to let you know about a situation with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVIDER] </em></span>regarding your <em><span style="color:#e74c3c;">[POLICY]</span></em>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
They have been a bit slow in responding to our request, which risks holding up our overall progress. As they have exceeded their own deadline for providing the information, I have raised a complaint on your behalf to help speed things up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I wanted to let you know because it’s likely that they will now be getting in touch with you. This is nothing to worry about, and if they have any questions, please refer them back to us.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I hope this will expedite the process and allow us to get on with the important bit: developing your personalised financial plan and LifeLine.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I’ll continue to keep you updated on our progress. If you have any questions, please do get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
