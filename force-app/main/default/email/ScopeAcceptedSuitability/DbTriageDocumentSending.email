<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Because you have a defined benefit pension, we’re required by current regulation to send you an information document about the features and benefits of these.<br />
<br />
We use a document provided by a third party (Royal London) to ensure impartiality. In order for us to talk through defined benefit pensions in any real detail, we need you to please read through this and confirm you’ve understood the content.<br />
<br />
I should stress, there’s no requirement to read this right now. However, should you wish to discuss your options for your pension in the future, it’s really important that you understand its features and benefits first.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy<br />
