<br />
I hope you're well.<br />
<br />
​We have contacted <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVIDER]</em></span> for the information we need in order to carry out our analysis ahead of your next meeting, however, they have confirmed that they hold a different <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADDRESS/NI NUMBER/DOB/etc]</em></span> for you and therefore can't provide us with the information we've asked for.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please could you contact them to update your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADDRESS/NI NUMBER/DOB/etc]</em></span> at your earliest convenience. You can do this by <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[RELAY PROVIDER INSTRUCTIONS. FOR eg CALL 0123456788 and speak with the X department quoting your policy number AB135677D].</em></span>​<br />
<br />
​You'll then be able to update your details and confirm that you wish to grant us access to information about this policy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
