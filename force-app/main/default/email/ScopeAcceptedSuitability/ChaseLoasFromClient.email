<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT 1 FIRST NAME] &amp; [CLIENT 2 FIRST NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Hope you are well.<br />
<br />
Further to our recent correspondence I wanted to give you a friendly reminder about the letters of authority we are yet to receive from you.<br />
<br />
Iâ€™d be really grateful if you could sign and return these, as they enable us to contact your providers and gain access to the information we need to advise you.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please do get in touch. I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
