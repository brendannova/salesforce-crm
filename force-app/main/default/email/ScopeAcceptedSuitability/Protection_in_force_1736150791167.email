<br />
Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Good news!</strong><br />
<br />
I have been in touch with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVIDER]</em></span> today and I am happy to confirm that your new <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[POLICY TYPE]</em></span> policy is in force as of today, <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[DATE]</em></span>. For your reference, your new policy number is <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[POLICY NUMBER]</em></span>.<br />
<br />
You will receive the policy documents via the post in the next 10 working days but in the meantime, I have uploaded copies to your document portal. As a reminder, you can access your </span><a href="https://portal.novawm.com/documents"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">document portal here</span></a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">using your existing email and password. You can also navigate there from the portal menu.<br />
<br />
Your first direct debit of Â£<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>XX.XX</em></span> will be taken from your bank account via direct debit on <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[DATE]</em></span>. Following your first payment, your direct debit will be taken on or around the <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[DATE]</em></span> of each month.<br />
<br />
You have the right to a period of reflection to consider the commitment you have made and to change your mind if you so wish. You have a period of 30 days from today to do this.<br />
<br />
<strong>What we need to do next</strong><br />
<br />
Now that your new cover is in force, we can start the process of placing your recommended&nbsp;<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em> [</em></span> policy/policies <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>]</em></span> into trust in force with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[</em></span> Solidus/<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>XX provider ]</em></span>. You'll receive another email from me early next week with the next steps for the trust application.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[IF CANCELLING REPLACEMENT BUSINESS PLEASE ADD]&nbsp;</em></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVDER]</em></span> has confirmed that you need to <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[INCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS FROM EXISTING PROVIDER TO CANCEL THEIR POLICY I.e. call on 0123456870 and quote your reference ABCDEFG]</em></span>. Unfortunately, <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PROVDER]</em></span> has confirmed that we're unable to do this for you on your behalf.<br />
<br />
I'd be grateful if you could confirm once you've managed to cancel your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ </em></span>policy/ies <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>]</em></span> so that I can update our records.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADD ANY OTHER STEPS]</em></span><br />
<br />
If you have any questions in the meantime, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
