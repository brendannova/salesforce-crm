<br />
As discussed recently, we want to explore whether purchasing a pension annuity is the right option for you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The first step is to complete a series of medical questions (underwriting) through our portal. This will cover your medical history and some additional lifestyle questions. It's really important to add as much detail as possible about yourself, as all information is used when calculating your pension income and even the smallest things could potentially increase the income available to you<br />
<br />
You will shortly receive two emails, one with your username and another with your password. Please use these to login to our annuity portal and follow the prompts from there.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please do get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
