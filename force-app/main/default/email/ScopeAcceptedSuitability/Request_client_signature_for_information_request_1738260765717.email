<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Client's Preferred Name]</em></span><br />
<br />
I hope this email finds you well.<br />
<br />
We recently sent an information request to <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Provider Name]</em></span> on your behalf. However, they have informed us that they require our form to be signed by you physically before they can proceed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We've sent you this form via post. To move this forward, we kindly ask you to: </span>
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sign the posted form</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Scan and email it back to us at amy@novawm.com</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> This is the quickest way to ensure we can proceed without delay.<br />
<br />
If scanning is not an option, you can return the signed form to us using the prepaid envelope included with the form.<br />
<br />
If you haven't received this within 5-7 business days, please get in touch &amp; we will send you a new form.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any questions or need assistance.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind regards&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Amy</span></span></body>
