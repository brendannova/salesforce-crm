Hope you are well.<br />

Iâ€™m getting in touch with regards to your shares in the Octopus Share Incentive Plan (SIP). For our analysis, we need some further information and would be grateful if you could please follow the steps below to give us a more detailed view of your holdings.
<ol>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Navigate to the Octopus Share Track Portal <a href="https://www.octoplusoptions.com/PortalLogOn?ReturnUrl=%2F"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">here</span></a></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Take a screenshot of (or print out) the 'My Shares' section of your profile, showing the number of shares and how long they have been held. Please also include the contribution level underneath the table, which will show how much you are contributing each month (if at all).</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Please also provide a screenshot (or print out) of the breakdown of these shares, which can be found by clicking on 'Full details' and is located below the contribution history.</span></span></li>

<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Once you have these, please email them to me and I will update our records to reflect this.<br />

If you have any questions, please let me know.<br />

Kind regards<br />
