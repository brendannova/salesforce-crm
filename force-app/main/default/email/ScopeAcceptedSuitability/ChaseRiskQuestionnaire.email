<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi<span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em> [CLIENT 1 FIRST NAME] &amp; [CLIENT 2 FIRST NAME]</em></span>,<br />
<br />
I hope you are well.<br />
<br />
As we continue to collect the information we need about your policies, please could I remind you to complete our risk questionnaire. This is used to help us invest in line with your goals and you'll have the opportunity to discuss the outcome with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[PARTNER’S NAME] </em></span>later on.<br />
<br />
The questionnaire was previously emailed to you on <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[DATE]</em></span>, but if you’d like me to resend it for you, please do let me know.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
