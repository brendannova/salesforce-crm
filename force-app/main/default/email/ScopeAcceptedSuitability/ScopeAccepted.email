<p style="line-height:1.38"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT 1 PREFERRED NAME] &amp; [CLIENT 2 PREFERRED NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
Thank you for confirming your agreement to go ahead.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We’ll now begin the work to build the full version of your Lifeline. We're also going to need a little more information from you. So, what happens now?<br />
<br />
<strong>What we’ll be doing</strong><br />
The next priority for us is to contact all the providers of your existing financial products. We will work with them to get extra information that can help us build our detailed plan and give the best advice.<br />
<br />
<em>A word of warning:</em> not everyone in the industry works at the pace we like to, so it can take some time (on average 8-12 weeks) for us to get all the information we need from your providers. We’ll be updating you on a regular basis on how we’re getting on and when we can move to the next stage of preparing your advice.<br />
<br />
<strong>What we need from you</strong><br />
As we build the full version of your plan, we’ll also need you to provide us with some additional information on key elements of your financial situation. Over the next week I’ll be sending a link to a follow-up set of questions, which will give us the details we need to create the best possible plan.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
