Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[CLIENT PREFERRED NAME]</em></span><br />
<br />
I hope you're well.<br />
<br />
I'm just getting in touch about your protection applications. Lifequote has informed us that they have contacted you to arrange a <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[[&nbsp;</em></span>tele-interview appointment/medical examination <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>]]</em></span> and have not managed to book this yet. Please could you contact them at your earliest convenience to schedule this.<br />
<br />
Once this is complete, they will be able to submit your application for assessment and underwriting.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
