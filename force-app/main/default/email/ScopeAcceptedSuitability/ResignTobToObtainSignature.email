In order to assist us in collecting information on your behalf from your providers, we need to collect an accurate version of your signature. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we collected this from your recent signing of Terms of Business.<br />
<br />
Therefore, please could you re-sign our Terms of Business with an accurate version of your signature at your earliest convenience. This will follow by email shortly.<br />
<br />
I hope this is clear and please let me know if you have any queries at all.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
