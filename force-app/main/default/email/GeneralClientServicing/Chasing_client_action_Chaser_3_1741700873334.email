<br />
I hope you’re well.<br />
<br />
Just another friendly reminder on my emails below.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be chasing, I realise you’re probably very busy. Rather than continue chasing and clogging up your inbox, I’ll wait for you to come back to me when you’re ready.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing back from you shortly.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
