<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi {{{Recipient.AddressedName__c}}},,<br />
<br />
I’m copying in Amy Farringdon who will be your tech assisted email support and will be handling all of the initial administrative work for the data gathering. Amy will let you know any further information we need from you in the coming days.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned when we last spoke, we have a bit of a process to go through on our side now in terms of ensuring we have all of the relevant information for you, including info on existing policies. Once Amy has let you know what we need from you, we’ll then speak to any providers on your behalf. We’ll keep you updated on how we’re progressing with this over the coming weeks and once we’ve got what we need, I’ll get back in touch to arrange our next meeting.<br />
<br />
If there’s anything you need from me in the meantime, please do let me know and I’m looking forward to working with you.<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />
<br />
