<strong>Book your catch-up call</strong><br />
The next step is to organise a quick catch-up call with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADVISER NAME]</em></span>, so we can prepare any updates to your advice ahead of your next meeting.<br />
<br />
For ease, please book your catch up call here. <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[&lt;- UPDATE LINK]:&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Complete your Risk Tolerance Questionnaire&nbsp;</strong><br />
As it's been more than three years since we last assessed your attitude to risk with our online questionnaire, we have sent this again to you today. This should take no longer than 5 minutes for you to complete.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Whilst we will regularly discuss investment risk with you in your advice meetings and you may feel nothing has changed, as an FCA-regulated firm we have a responsibility to periodically verify these discussions with a more quantitative approach.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will analyse your results and will discuss this in more detail in your next meeting.<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, please get in touch.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></p>
