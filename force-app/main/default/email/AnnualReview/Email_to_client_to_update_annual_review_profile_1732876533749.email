<br />
I’m happy to say that it’s time for you to book your next meeting with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADVISER NAME]</em></span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your annual review pack</strong><br />
You’ll be pleased to know that we’ve already completed an annual review pack for you. This contains some basic information (like performance and fees), much of which you already have access to in the portal.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Covering this information here will mean that more of your next meeting can be spent discussing you, your goals, and how we are going to help you achieve them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To access the review pack, please <a href="https://portal.novawm.com/documents/">visit your document store</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Book your meeting</strong><br />
