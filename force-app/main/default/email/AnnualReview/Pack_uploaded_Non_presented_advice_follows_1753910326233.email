<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Hi <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Client 1]</em></span> &amp; <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[Client 2]</em></span><br />
<br />
Following your catch up call with <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADVISER NAME]</em></span>, be pleased to know that we’ve completed an annual review pack for you.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your annual review pack</strong><br />
This contains some basic information (like performance and fees), much of which you already have access to in the portal.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Covering this information here will mean that more of any future meetings can be spent discussing you, your goals, and how we are going to help you achieve them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To access the review pack, please visit </span><a href="https://portal.novawm.com/documents/"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">your document store</span></a><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">.<br />
<br />
We’ll be in touch shortly with our advice for you, at which point you can book a meeting with your <span style="color:#e74c3c;"><em>[ADVISER NAME]</em></span>, if you wish to discuss any of this in more detail.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have any questions at all, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Amy</span></body>
